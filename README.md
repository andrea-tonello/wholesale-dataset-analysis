# Wholesale dataset analysis
The dataset considered in this analysis (available on kaggle.com) contains the annual expenses of customers of a wholesale merchant.

We first performed exploratory data analysis; then, we constructed regression models for every selected couple of variabes (one conditionally to the other) and we chose the best one with respect to the R^2 parameter, kurtosis index and others parameters. Finally, the best linear regression model has been used for making a prediction.
